Currently, big record labels take a large portion of artist earnings. In 2017, the industry generated $43 billion, and artists only saw 12% of that. While technology has come a long way over the decades, the industry's business model - that is inherently unfair to artists - has not followed suit. Radiochain is here to change that.",

                    "description": "Radiochain turns the world's music library into a stock market exchange using the latest blockchain technology. Every song on the platform has its own stock that fans can invest in. Instead of buying and selling shares of traditional companies, people can invest directly into their favorite artists and tunes. This model, coupled with the use of on-chain smart contracts, creates a new avenue for artists to earn money and do what they love."
